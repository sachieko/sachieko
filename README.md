- 👋 Hi, I’m @sachieko
- 👀 I’m interested in data science and web development. If you'd like to collaborate on a project, feel free to reach out!
- 🦜 I’m a full stack web developer with experience using Javascript, Ruby on Rails, React, and Typescript!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate or work on Open Source projects!
- I am currently spending time working on my L5R SRD project, which is in my [lo5r-app repo](https://github.com/sachieko/lo5r-app)!

I have a background in statistics and secondary math education, but coding is where I'm happy.
