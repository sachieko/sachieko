I’m @sachieko
- 🦜 I’m a web developer with experience using Typescript, Javascript, Ruby on Rails, React, C#, some C, and Python!
- 🥱 It's a bucketlist item at this point to use Godot and C# to build a new hobby project.
- 💞️ I am currently spending time working on my L5R SRD project, which is in my [lo5r-app repo](https://github.com/sachieko/lo5r-app)!
- ✅ I recently just finished a dynamic sheet template for the 5th edition of Legend of the Five Rings, available on [Obsidian Portal](https://www.obsidianportal.com/)!

I have a background in statistics and secondary math education, but coding is where I'm happy.

I probably have 3 or 4 sideprojects that I am balancing inbetween everything.
