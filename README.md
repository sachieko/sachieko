I’m @sachieko or Yuseiko (由清子).

You may know me cause of my work on a couple TTRPG community projects related to Legend of the Five Rings, though I am personally not affiliated with them at this time: 
* I currently am the sole developer behind the L5R SRD project at [https://lo5r.yuseiko.org](https://lo5r.yuseiko.org) for both the front-end, back-end, and related database schema and seeds. 
* I am also the sole developer behind [Shukumei Bot](https://github.com/sachieko/shukumei) which is a Dice and Utility bot for the Tabletop Roleplaying Game: *Legend of the Five Rings 5th Edition (Licensed by Edge Studio under Fantasy Flight Games)*
* I have a future plan to create an android and website platform for creating character sheets.

My special areas of expertise and study outside of Computer Science are Mathematics and Statistics, and Japanese Language and Culture.
