👋 Hi, I’m @sachieko
- 👀 I’m interested in data science and web development. If you'd like to collaborate on a project, feel free to reach out!
- 🦜 I’m a web developer with experience using Typescript, Javascript, Ruby on Rails, React, and Python!
- 💞️ I’m currently creating a Game Design Document to prepare for using Godot and C# to build a new hobby project.
  
- I am currently spending time working on my L5R SRD project, which is in my [lo5r-app repo](https://github.com/sachieko/lo5r-app)!
- I recently just finished a dynamic sheet template for the 5th edition of Legend of the Five Rings, available on [Obsidian Portal](https://www.obsidianportal.com/)!

I have a background in statistics and secondary math education, but coding is where I'm happy.
