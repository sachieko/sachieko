- 👋 Hi, I’m @sachieko
- 👀 I’m interested in data science and web development.
- 🦜 I’m a full stack web developer with experience using Javascript, Ruby on Rails, React, and I also know a bit of Python.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects, and if it's Typescript I'd like the opportunity to work more with that language!

I have a background in statistics and secondary math education, so I can also crunch some numbers.
